=head1 NAME


F<timersdone.conf> – pending timers created by search timers


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This file contains pending timers that have been created by search timers. If
the setup option C<Recreate timers after deletion> is set to C<no>, EPGSearch
uses this list to check whether a timer has already been created and, if so,
does not create the timer again. As soon as the associated recording has taken
place, the timer is automatically removed from this list.

=head1 FORMAT

Every line represents a pending timer,
comprising the following fields:

=over 4

=item B<1 – Channel identifier>

String with the timer's channel identifier in VDR notation
(e.g., C<S19.2E-1-1019-10301>).

=item B<2 – Start time>

The timer's start date and time in I<Epoch> encoding
(i.e., seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00 UTC).

=item B<3 – Stop time>

The timer's stop date and time in I<Epoch> encoding
(i.e., seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00 UTC).

=item B<4 – Search-timer identifier>

Integer with the unique identifier of the search timer
that has created the timer.

=item B<5 – Title>

String with the event's title.

=item B<6 – Subtitle>

String with the event's subtitle.

=item B<7 – Details>

String containing the date and start time of the timer,
as well as the name (or alternatively, the number) of the channel.

=back

Fields are separated by C<:> characters. Thus, a C<:> character
in title, subtitle, or details will be translated to a C<|> character.
