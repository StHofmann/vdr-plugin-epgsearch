=head1 NAME

F<epgsearchchangrps.conf> – channel groups

=head1 DESCRIPTION

In EPGSearch, channels can form channel groups, which can be
used in searches and search timers. This allows the central
management of channels to be scanned for multiple searches
and search timers.

The channel groups are saved in this file.

=head1 SYNTAX

Each line defines a channel group and starts with the group name,
followed by the list of channels it comprises. A C<|> character serves
as field separator.
