=head1 NAME

F<epgsearchcmds.conf> – EPG commands

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This file contains commands that – like for the VDR's F<commands.conf>
or F<reccmds.conf> – can be applied to the selected event in one of the
EPG menus. However, nested commands, as introduced by VDR 1.7.12, are
not supported.

EPGSearch has eight preset commands. If a file  F<epgsearchcmds.conf>
exists, its commands will be appended to the list of the internal commands
and start at position 9.

=head2 Localization

If you like to have a language-dependent list of commands, simply
translate your present F<epgsearchcmds.conf> to your preferred OSD
language and store it with the filename F<epgsearchcmds-E<lt>LOCE<gt>.conf>,
where F<E<lt>LOCE<gt>> is the locale's code from F<i18n.c>:

=over 4

    { "eng,dos",
      "deu,ger",
      "slv",
      "ita",
      "dut,nla,nld",
      "por",
      "fra,fre",
      "nor",
      "fin,smi",
      "pol",
      "esl,spa",
      "ell,gre",
      "sve,swe",
      "rom,rum",
      "hun",
      "cat,cln",
      "rus",
      "hrv",
      "est",
      "dan"
      // see the source file
      // for the complete list
    }

=back

If more codes are listed for a language (e.g., C<eng,dos>), choose
one of them.

If a file corresponding to the VDR's OSD language is available, it
will be loaded. If no such file exists, the system will attempt to
load the F<epgsearchcmds.conf> file instead.

=head2 Command parameters

When a command is executed, the following parameters will be provided:

=over 4

=item B<$1>

Title of the EPG entry.

=item B<$2>

Start time of the EPG entry in I<Epoch> encoding
(i.e., seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00 UTC), like in the shutdown script.

=item B<$3>

Stop time of the EPG entry in I<Epoch> encoding
(i.e., seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00 UTC).

=item B<$4>

Channel number of the EPG entry.

=item B<$5>

Long channel name of the EPG entry.

=item B<$6>

Subtitle of the EPG entry, or an empty string if not present.

=back

Strings are enclosed in single quotes (apostrophes) when the command
is called.

=head1 SYNTAX

Every line within the file represents a user-defined command,
comprising the following fields:

=over 4

=item B<Menu entry>

Term under which the command shall appear in the command list.
The term must not contain C<:> characters. If the term ends with
a C<?> character, confirmation will be requested before the command
is executed.

=item B<Command>

Program or script to be executed when the command is invoked.
The use of full pathnames is recommended.

=back

The fields are separated by a C<:> character. if contained in the
command's invocation, a C<:> character does not need to be treated
specially, that is, be replaced with a specific substitute.

Lines beginning with a C<#> character represent comments and are ignored.

=head1 EXAMPLES

 Remember event?               : /usr/local/bin/rememberevent.sh 0
 Remember and switch to event? : /usr/local/bin/rememberevent.sh 1
 Show EPG                      : /usr/local/bin/epg2taste.sh

The above scripts, amongst others, can be found in the directory
F<scripts> of the EPGSearch sources.
