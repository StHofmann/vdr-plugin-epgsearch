=head1 NAME

F<epgsearchblacklists.conf> – blacklist for searches and search timers

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Blacklists can be created for searches and search timers and are saved
in this file.

Blacklists are essentially the same as normal searches. One or more
blacklists can be selected for each search or search timer as needed.

As an example, consider a search timer "Crime" that is intended to find all
crime series. The blacklist "Columbo", on the other hand, retrieves all
episodes of the crime series "Columbo."

If the blacklist "Columbo" is added to the search timer "Crime", all crime
series are first searched for, and the results are then compared with the results
in the blacklist. Events that are also included in the results of the blacklist
are then discarded.

=head1 SYNTAX

This file has a format similar to F<epgsearch.conf>.
However, blacklists are no search timers, but rather "simple" searches.
Therefore, the fields ("parameters") that are only needed for timer
management, such as C<use as search timer>, are irrelevant and omitted.
The fields are also arranged differently than in search timers for
historical reasons.

Blacklists include the following fields, which (with the exception of
field 22) are also present in search timers:

=over 4

=item B<1 – Unique identifier>

=item B<2 – Search term>

=item B<3 – Use time>

=item B<4 – Start after [HHMM]>

=item B<5 – Start before [HHMM]>

=item B<6 – Use channel>

=item B<7 – Channel selection>

=item B<8 – Match case>

=item B<9 – Search mode>

=item B<10 – Use title>

=item B<11 – Use subtitle>

=item B<12 – Use description>

=item B<13 – Use duration>

=item B<14 – Minimum duration [HHMM]>

=item B<15 – Maximum duration [HHMM]>

=item B<16 – Use day of week>

=item B<17 – Day of week>

=item B<18 – Use extended EPG information>

=item B<19 – Extended EPG information values>

=item B<20 – Fuzzy tolerance>

=item B<21 – Matching mode of extended EPG information>

Z<>

=item B<22 – Use as global blacklist>

Flag with values 0 = no, 1 = yes.

=item B<23 – Content descriptors>

=item B<25 – Matching mode of special characteristics>

=item B<26 – Use parental rating>

=item B<27 – Minimum parental rating>

=item B<28 – Maximum parental rating>

=back

A blacklists's entry is considered valid if covers at least the first 19 fields.

For common fields of blacklists and search timers, the specifications
from B<epgsearch.conf>(5) apply.
