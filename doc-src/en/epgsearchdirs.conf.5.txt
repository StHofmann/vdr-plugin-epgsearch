=head1 NAME

F<epgsearchdirs.conf> â€“ recording directories

=head1 DESCRIPTION

In EPGSearch, you often have to enter entire directory paths,
for example, when editing search timers. Since this is rather
tedious, frequently used paths can be specified in this file,
which can then be easily selected from the menu.

This file is one of the sources for the C<Select directory> menu.
The items displayed are collected from the following sources:

=over 2

=item * current recording directories

=item * current timer directories

=item * directories used in search timers

=item * directories specified in this file

=item * entries in the VDR file F<folders.conf>

=back

The menu consolidates the found directories and displays only distinct
ones. The key C<yellow> allows changing the level of the directories
shown. Items containing EPG category variables, like C<%Genre%>,
always appear before other directories. They also do not depend on
the level and are shown with their full directory path.

If this menu is called from the timer-edit menu and the selected item
already contains the variables C<%Title%> or C<%Subtitle>, the timer's
C<File> entry gets cleared, since title or subtitle already included
in the C<Directory> item.

=head1 SYNTAX

Each line contains the pathname of a directory that can include
variables, if necessary.
You can use internal variables, those of EPG categories configured
in F<epgsearchcats.conf>, and variables defined in F<epgsearchuservars.conf>.

The following internal variables are available:

=over 4

=item B<%Time%>

An event's start time in 'HH:MM' format.

=item B<%Time_D%>

An event's start date in 'DD' format.

=item B<%Time_W%>

Name of the weekday on which an event starts.

=item B<%Time_Lng%>

An event's start date and time in I<Epoch> encoding
(i.e., seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00 UTC).

=item B<%Date%>

An event's start date in 'DD.MM.YY' format.

=item B<%DateSh%>

An event's start date in 'DD.MM' format.

=item B<%Title%>

An event's title.

=item B<%Subtitle%>

An event's subtitle.

=back

Also see B<epgsearchcats.conf>(5) and B<epgsearchuservars.conf>(5)
for further variables.
