=head1 NAME

F<epgsearchswitchtimer.conf> – switch timers

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Switch timers can be created in EPGSearch via the menu C<Schedules>
or by means of search timers. They can switch the channel at the
beginning of an event or just inform about an event's start by OSD.

The switch timers are saved in this file.

=head1 SYNTAX

Every line represents a switch timer,
comprising the following fields:

=over 4

=item B<1 – Channel identifier>

String with the channel identifier in VDR notation (e.g., C<S19.2E-1-1019-10301>).

=item B<2 – Event identifier>

Integer with the VDR's unique event identifier.

=item B<3 – Start time>

The event's start date and time in I<Epoch> encoding
(i.e., seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00 UTC).

=item B<5 – Margin at start [minutes]>

=for consideration:
Should we limit the margins to some reasonable value, like 2 hours = 0..120?

Integer with a positive value.

=item B<5 – Action>

Enumeration with the following values:

=over 4

=item 0 = switch only

=item 1 = announce by OSD

=item 2 = announce by OSD and switch

=back

Z<>

=item B<6 – Unmute sound>

Flag with values 0 = no, 1 = yes.

=back

The fields of a switch timer are separated by C<:> characters.
